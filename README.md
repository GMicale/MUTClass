# MUTClass
Java implementation of MUTClass algorithm for the identification of targeted panels of genes able to classify cancer patients.
The Java package includes the following 3 software:
- **DMGSFinder**: Extract from a mutation matrix two panels of mutated genes characterizing positive and negative panels, respectively.
- **MUTClassCV**: Run a cross-validation test of MUTClass algorithm on a mutation matrix 
- **MUTClass**: Train MUTClass on a mutation matrix A and test the algorithm on a mutation matrix B in order to classify samples of B.
